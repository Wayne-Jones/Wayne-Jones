# Hi I'm Wayne Jonesüëã

I‚Äôm a Software Engineer from New York, NY. I have been doing Front-End and Full Stack Engineering for the past 9 years professionally working with various companies ranging from fintech to SaaS. When I'm not coding, I am a Co-Founder and Board Member of my own non-profit, [NYC Gaymers](https://www.gaymers.nyc/), whose mission is to create safe and inclusive spaces for the LGBTQ+ gamer community in New York City through education and advocacy. I'm also a photographer / videographer who regularly host creator meetups for [Creators NYC](https://www.instagram.com/creatorsnyc). I also love networking with my local developer community meetups.

## What I'm looking to do üíª

I'm looking for a Senior Engineering role working on building responsive and accessible User Interfaces. In addition, I'm looking to dive into Developer Relations by doing speaking engagements both in person and virtually to give back and share my knowledge of being a Software Engineer to those that are looking to getting into the field.
